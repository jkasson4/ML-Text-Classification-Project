# ML-Text-Classification-Project
Building text classification models for Machine Learning course at The University of Texas at Dallas.

## Text Semantics
Dataset: 35,000 IMDB reviews.\
Determines whether the reviewer left a positive or negative review.

## SMS Spam Detection
Dataset: 3,902 SMS messages.\
Determines whether an SMS message is spam.

## Fraudulent Job Description
